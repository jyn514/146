# 146
Instructions, lectures, and completed code for the course [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://cse.sc.edu/class/146).
`Lectures` are the contents of [JJ's site](https://cse.sc.edu/~shephejj/csce146/) at the end of a semester.
`General` is all the raw code in a heap.
`Homework` and `Labs` are mostlly symbolic links and main methods.
`Extra Credit` I will get around to someday. Probably.
