Ordered least to greatest:

O(1) - random access
O(log2(n)) - binary search, balanced-tree insertion
O(n) - linear search, non-random access, (optimal) largest in list, unbalanced-tree insertion
O(n log2(n)) - merge sort, heap sort
O(n^2) - bubblesort, quicksort, selection sort, insertion sort
O(n^3) - matrix multiplication
O(2^n) - tower of hanoi (optimal)
O(n!) - (naive) largest in list, (optimal) traveling salesman
O(n^n) - (naive) chess algorithms, (optimal) tetration

Each is asymptotically bounded by function
Fastest: grows to infinity slower

P vs NP:
P: n^k
NP: O > n^k
